      <h1>About Me</h1>   
      <p>
        Hello, I am Erickson M. Manabat. I live in Barangay Bago, General Tinio, Nueva Ecija. I am the son of Mr. Enrico Manabat and Ms. Sherlyn Manabat,
         and I am the second of six children. My eldest brother is Rennier Manabat; he is no longer studying. After me is my sister, Angilyn Manabat, a Grade 11 ABM student. 
         Next is my brother, Enrico Manabat Jr., who is in Grade 9, followed by my little sister, Angela Manabat, who is four years old. Our youngest, Jandy Manabat, has passed away and is now in a better place, free from pain.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I studied at Nazareth Elementary School because we used to live in Barangay Nazareth. I almost didn't graduate from Grade 6 because I spent too much time watching anime on GMA, but thanks to my parents guidance, I went back to school. 
        Even though I felt embarrassed after being absent for about three weeks, I was still able to graduate.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>For high school, I attended Lino P. Bernardo National High School. Until Grade 8, I walked to school because I didn't have a motorcycle.
         When COVID-19 began, we shifted to modular learning. By Grade 9, I wasn't able to choose a strand. 
         Since my older brother took SMAW, the school assigned me SMAW modules as my major, and I continued SMAW until Grade 12
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>From Grades 10 to 12, I stayed in Bago, which was closer to school than Nazareth. We lived in the place where my father was assigned as a worker and caretaker. 
        After graduating from Grade 12, I took the NEUST Papaya Off-Campus entrance exam and passed. I entered college as a first-year student, and now I am starting my second year. 
        I hope to pass again so I can achieve my dreams. I may not be the smartest, but I am determined to finish my studies for the sake of my future

      <h1>My drawing</h1>
   <p class="description">Those drawings of mine have been left unfinished for a long time because I didn't have the materials and I no longer had much time to draw.
     When I was a child, I really loved drawing, but as I grew older, I wasn't able to continue.That's why my drawings are no longer like before, and my drawing skills haven't improved.</p>

        <h1>Some of my favorite anime</h1>
            <p class="description">
              These are the kinds of anime I like mostly action anime, and I can promise that all of them are really good.
               Back in elementary school, there were times when I skipped classes just to watch anime.
               Luckily, I still managed to pass Grade 6. If my parents hadn't scolded me and pushed me to attend school, I might not be here now at Papaya Off-Campus. 
               I've learned that you really need to manage your time so you won't be overwhelmed with tasks, because anime or any show has its proper time to be enjoyed.</p>

      <h1>My games</h1>
       <p class="description">The online games I play are what I turn to when I have nothing to do or when I feel too lazy to draw, since I don't have anything to draw on. 
        Instead, I play online games like CODM (Call of Duty Mobile), MLBB (Mobile Legends: Bang Bang), and Roblox. 
        I only play occasionally, usually when I have free time, and nowadays I don't get to play as much anymore. Life is like a game you won't always win, and you won't always lose. Learn to find a way to win.

       <p class="description">This is my Mobile Legends account. I'm not a pro player, and I don't even get to play often since there are times I lose interest in online games.
              For me, ML is just a part of a gamer's life but life can't revolve around online games alone. There are more important things to focus on, like studying and working.
              Sure, you can gain popularity from gaming, but that fame doesn't last forever. By finishing my studies, I know a better future is waiting for me.

       <p class="description">This is my Roblox account. I started playing Roblox because friends would often invite me. 
            Since we couldn't always meet up in person, especially with the distance, the game became a way for us to spend time together like hanging out, exploring places, and going on adventures.
             At first, I thought Roblox was just for kids, but later I realized it has so many different games and experiences that anyone can enjoy. 
             For me, Roblox isn't just a game, it's also a way to connect with people, share moments, and have fun no matter where we are.

        <div>
           <p>One of my first achievements was serving as the leader of Group 3 in a research project.
             Our group received the Outstanding Output Award for our study entitled The Use of Wall-Mounted Tables to Enhance Limited Space.
            This project was later donated to one of the classrooms of Grade 11 ACAD-A at Lino P. Bernardo National High School, where I completed my secondary education. </p>

        <div>
          <p> Once again, I served as the leader of our research titled The Use of a Multipurpose Podium in Assisting Class Discussions.
             This study also won the Outstanding Output Award in research. Similar to our first project, this research was donated to the SMAW (Shielded Metal Arc Welding) strand,
              where I completed my senior high school education. The project was suggested by my SMAW-12 adviser, and I personally designed the project layout on two bond papers for the final research title presentation. </p>

        <img src="image/achievement3.jpg" alt="achievement3">
        <div>
           <p>I received the Outstanding Presenter Award for our second research project. 
            I was very happy each time we finished a defense, especially since all of my defenses were successfully passed. This award was something I did not expect to achieve.
             However, I did anticipate winning the Outstanding Output Award because our strand, TVL-A (SMAW), was the only one that produced multifunctional projects such as the Multipurpose Podium. </p>

      <div class="item5">
        <img src="image/achievement4.jpg" alt="achievement4">
       <div>
          <p>The last achievement i list is receiving Honor Certificates during my Grade 12 year. 
            In the first quarter, I ranked second in the class with an average of 90. In the second quarter, my average increased to 91,followed by 92 in both the third and final quarters.
            From the first to the last quarter, I consistently maintained the Top 2 position in our class.Despite this, I still held the highest overall average in the TVL-A (SMAW) strand,
            with a final average of 92. This became a very meaningful accomplishment for me because I was able to graduate with a medal for the first time. 
            I had promised myself that I would graduate with a medal, and I achieved it. My next goal is to graduate with a degree in Information Technology, and I am determined to reach it.</p>
